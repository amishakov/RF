# Coming in 2024

I'm pleased to announce that the Pragmatic Bookshelf will be publishing a fully-revised and updated second edition of Risk-First Software Development!

[![Pragmatic Bookshelf](https://media.pragprog.com/images/cms/logos/Bookshelf_4in.png)](https://pragprog.com)

## Risk-First Software Development Second Edition

**Over 20 years ago an "Agile" revolution occurred** in the software development field.  But 20 years later, the very same proponents of the revolution are turning their backs on what they created, arguing that their ideals have been corrupted by zealotry, proscriptive norms, cargo-culting and an "Agile-Industrial Complex" focused on evangelism and certification.

**Risk-First attempts something new:**   to "peel back the onion" and provide a language for understanding and evaluating not just Agile practices but *all practices* in software development.  Unlike the Agile of today, Risk-First is not a methodology telling you what to do, but a toolbox and a pattern language to help you figure out what you should do, and help you communicate with others to make your case.

The book aims to develop a **Pattern Language for understanding software risk**, and develop a practical framework for discussing how the activities we take on a project change the balance of the risks we are exposed to.
