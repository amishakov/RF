## Tracks

There is quite a lot of material on this site so to aid digestion Risk-First is split into several main _tracks_.  These are shown on the menu at the top of this page and also in the navigator.  Here's what we have so far:

1. **The Overview (This Bit)**:  Summary materials and how to navigate the site.
 
2. **[Thinking Risk-First](../thinking/Start.md)**: Thinking about Software Development from a new perspective - it's not about code and issues and bugs and releases.  Those things represent ways in which we deal with risks.
  
3. **[Risks](../risks/Start.md)**:  Here, we try and break down the different risks that you face on a software project and talk at a high level about the kind of actions you take to deal with them.
 
4. **[On Bets](../bets/Start.md)**: If software development is all about risk then doesn't that make us all gamblers?  Here, we look at the types of bets we make every day when building software and look at how we might try to maximise our profits.

5. **[On Estimating](../estimating/Start.md)**: _Estimating_ is the _bÃªte noire_ of software development: simple to conceptualise but a mine-field for the unwary. Here, we take it apart from a Risk-First perspective to try and understand _why_ it is so difficult and what we should do about it.
 
6. **[On Complexity](../complexity/Start.md)**:  _(Under Construction)_ The complexity of the work we do is a big source of risk.  Can we understand it better?
