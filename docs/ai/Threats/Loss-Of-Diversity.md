## Risk Score: Medium

A lack of diversity could create system-wide vulnerabilities, where a single flaw in a dominant AI model causes widespread failure.

## Description

AI development is increasingly controlled by a small number of corporations and governments, leading to monopolistic control over critical systems.

## Sources

**Bostrom & Shulman, "Global AI Governance" (2021):** Discusses the risks of a single dominant AI system shaping global decision-making. If AI governance converges around a monolithic framework, any flaw or misalignment in the system could have catastrophic consequences at a planetary scale.

**OpenAI’s Research on AI Model Homogeneity (2022):** Highlights concerns that if AI models become too similar—due to the concentration of AI development within a few major entities—there could be systemic vulnerabilities, lack of innovation, and a failure to address diverse global needs.

## How This Is Already Happening

- **Centralisation of AI Development:** The majority of cutting-edge AI models are being developed by a small group of technology giants, creating an ecosystem where a few dominant models dictate global AI capabilities. This raises the risk that any flaw, bias, or vulnerability present in these models will propagate worldwide.
    
- **Monoculture Effects in AI Decision-Making:** AI is increasingly being embedded into critical decision-making systems (finance, healthcare, military strategy). If all of these systems rely on a few underlying models, unexpected failures or adversarial attacks could spread rapidly across multiple industries.
    
- **Lack of Innovation Due to Model Homogeneity:** When the same AI architectures are used across different sectors, it stifles alternative approaches that might better serve specialized needs. A uniform AI landscape risks optimizing for narrow commercial objectives rather than the diverse interests of different populations and industries.

- **Mass Surveillance & Social Control:** Governments and corporations use AI to track and influence populations.  [Example: ClearView](https://www.clearview.ai)

## Can Risk Management Address This Risk?

Partially. Traditional risk management can identify and highlight the dangers of AI monoculture, but effective mitigation requires strong regulatory intervention and industry-wide commitment—both of which are difficult to enforce under current economic incentives.
