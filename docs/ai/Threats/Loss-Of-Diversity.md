**Impact: 3** - A lack of diversity could create system-wide vulnerabilities, where a single flaw in a dominant AI model causes widespread failure.

## Sources

**Bostrom & Shulman, "Global AI Governance" (2021):** Discusses the risks of a single dominant AI system shaping global decision-making. If AI governance converges around a monolithic framework, any flaw or misalignment in the system could have catastrophic consequences at a planetary scale.

**OpenAI’s Research on AI Model Homogeneity (2022):** Highlights concerns that if AI models become too similar—due to the concentration of AI development within a few major entities—there could be systemic vulnerabilities, lack of innovation, and a failure to address diverse global needs.

## How This Is Already Happening

- **Centralisation of AI Development:** The majority of cutting-edge AI models are being developed by a small group of technology giants, creating an ecosystem where a few dominant models dictate global AI capabilities. This raises the risk that any flaw, bias, or vulnerability present in these models will propagate worldwide.
    
- **Monoculture Effects in AI Decision-Making:** AI is increasingly being embedded into critical decision-making systems (finance, healthcare, military strategy). If all of these systems rely on a few underlying models, unexpected failures or adversarial attacks could spread rapidly across multiple industries.
    
- **Lack of Innovation Due to Model Homogeneity:** When the same AI architectures are used across different sectors, it stifles alternative approaches that might better serve specialized needs. A uniform AI landscape risks optimizing for narrow commercial objectives rather than the diverse interests of different populations and industries.
    

## Mitigations

- **Ecosystem Diversity**
    - Encouraging the development of multiple, independent AI models instead of relying on a single dominant system.
    - **Efficacy: High** - Diversified AI systems reduce systemic risks and encourage innovation.
    - **Ease of Implementation: Medium** - Requires regulatory incentives or decentralized AI development initiatives.
- **Multi-Stakeholder Oversight**
    - Ensuring that AI governance involves multiple institutions, including governments, researchers, and civil society, to prevent monopolization.
    - **Efficacy: Medium** - Helps distribute AI power more equitably but may struggle with enforcement.
    - **Ease of Implementation: Medium** - Requires cooperation between multiple sectors, which can be slow and politically complex.
- **Transparency**
    - Requiring AI developers to publish model architectures, data sources, and decision-making rationales.
    - **Efficacy: Medium** - Increases accountability but does not prevent monopolization directly.
    - **Ease of Implementation: Medium** - Transparency regulations are becoming more common but face resistance from corporate interests.

## Can Risk Management Address This Risk?

Partially. Traditional risk management can identify and highlight the dangers of AI monoculture, but effective mitigation requires strong regulatory intervention and industry-wide commitment—both of which are difficult to enforce under current economic incentives.
