### Replication Control

- Replication control becomes relevant when an AI system can duplicate itself—or be duplicated—beyond the reach of any central authority (analogous to a computer virus—though with potentially far greater autonomy and adaptability).  
- An organization/person builds a very capable AI with some misaligned objectives. If they distribute its model or code openly, it effectively becomes “in the wild.”
- Could controls be put in place to prevent this from happening? TODO: figure this out.

- **Efficacy:** Medium – Limits the spread of potentially rogue AI copies.  
- **Ease of Implementation:** Low – In open-source communities or decentralized systems, controlling replication requires broad consensus and technical enforcement measures.
