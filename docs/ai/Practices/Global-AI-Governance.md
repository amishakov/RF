- Agreements between countries, similar to financial regulations, could establish shared standards for AI ethics, accountability, and human involvement in AI-controlled economies.

- Challenging to implement due to differing national interests, enforcement issues, and political resistance.

- Industry-wide codes of conduct to discourage manipulative AI.

- Incentivize designers to embed fairness and user consent into algorithmic systems.

- Professional bodies and industry coalitions can quickly adopt and publicise guidelines, though ensuring universal adherence remains a challenge. Firms have varying incentives, budgets, and ethical priorities, making universal buy-in elusive.
