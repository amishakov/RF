# Interference Checklist

Here is an example "Interference Checklist", which you can use to estimate the risk on your stories / tasks.  For an explanation of how this works, check out the previous article [On Story Points](On-Story-Points.md).

This is just meant to be used as a starting point - feel free to adapt this to the specifics of your own projects and environments.

## Some Simple Instructions

1.  Next time you are asked to estimate a piece of work, run through the checklist.  
2.  Assign a "point value" of your own to any important items.  You can use numbers, S-M-L, whatever.
3.  Total up the points.   For a _low score_ you should feel fairly happy about hitting a given end-date for a piece of work.  For a high score, you should have low confidence in your estimate.
4.  Consider breaking up risky work into smaller units to isolate the risks individually.   
5.  Consider removing unnecessary risk from the project. 
6.  After, or during a piece of work, add any new risks you discover to the checklist to remind you about them next time.
