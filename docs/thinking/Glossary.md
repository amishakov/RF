# Glossary

### Abstraction

The process of removing physical, spatial, or temporal details or attributes in the study of objects or systems in order to more closely attend to other details of interest.  

_See: [Complexity Risk](../risks/Complexity-Risk.md)_

### Agent

Agency is the capacity of an actor to act in a given environment.  We use the term _agent_ to refer to any process, person, system or organisation with agency. 

_See: [Agency Risk](../risks/Agency-Risk.md)_

### Anti-Goal

The opposite of a [Goal](#goal), that is, something you are working hard to avoid happening.

_See: [Goal (Tag)](/tags/goal)_

### Balance Of Risk

The distribution of possible returns, given the set of risks you face from your position on the [Risk Landscape](#risk-landscape).  

_See: [Balance Of Risk (Tag)](/tags/balance-of-risk)_

### Bet

Taking a decision to move somewhere new on the [Risk Landscape](#risk-landscape) and change the [Balance Of Risk](#balance-of-risk).  

_See: [Bets (Tag)](/tags/bets)_

### De-Risk

To [Take Action](#taking-action) to make (something) less risky.

### Expected Return

The [return](#return) (that is, a percentage gain or loss) of a bet or investment aggregated over all possible outcomes, each weighted according to its likelihood.

_See: [Bets (Tag)](/tags/bets)_

### Expected Value

The [value](#value) (that is, net amount made or lost) of a bet or investment aggregated over all possible outcomes, each weighted according to its likelihood.

_See: [Bets (Tag)](/tags/bets)_

### Feedback Loop

The process of testing an [Internal Model](#internal-model), through [taking action](#taking-action) to [Meet Reality](#meet-reality).  Typically, we talk about short or long feedback loops, depending on the intervals between [Meeting Reality](#meet-reality).  

_See: [Feedback Loop (Tag)](/tags/feedback-loop)_

### Goal

A picture of the future that an individual or team carries within their [Internal Model](#internal-model);  An imagined destination on the [Risk Landscape](#risk-landscape).  A specific [Upside Risk](#upside-risk) we'd like to nurture and realize. _See: [A Simple Scenario](../thinking/A-Simple-Scenario.md)_

_See: [Goal (Tag)](/tags/goal)_

### Internal Model

The model of reality held by an individual, team, software system or other [Agent](#agent).   You can regard the concept of [Internal Model](#internal-model) as being what you _know_ and what you _think_ about a certain situation.  An internal model _represents_ reality:  reality is made of matter, whereas the internal model is information.

Obviously, because we've all had different experiences, and our brains are wired up differently: everyone will have a different [Internal Model](#internal-model) of reality.  

- Within an organisation, we might consider the [Internal Model](#internal-model) of a _team of people_ to be the shared knowledge, values and working practices of that team.
- Within a software system, we might consider the [Internal Model](#internal-model) of a single server, and what knowledge it has of the world.
- A codebase is a team's [Internal Model](#internal-model) written down and encoded as software.

_See: [Internal Model (Tag)](/tags/internal-model)_

### Meet Reality

Any moment where we test an [Internal Model](#internal-model) by exposing it's predictive power against reality.  Note that "Reality" might be limited in some way, for example, a trial period or test users.   

_See: [Meet Reality (Tag)](/tags/meet-reality)_

### Opportunity

A term often used instead of [Upside Risk](#upside-risk) as something you'd like to happen.

_See: [Upside Risk](#upside-risk)

### Payoff

Payoff refers to the _value_ of the [actions we take](#taking-action).  When we decide on a course of action, we have in mind a risk we wish to manage.  If the action is likely to have a big positive effect on the risk of a project, we say it has a promising payoff, whereas if the action fails to manage the risk, then it hasn't _paid off_.   

_See: [Payoff (Tag)](/tags/payoff)_

### Return

For a given bet or investment, the net value made or lost as a percentage of the initial investment cost or stake.

_See: [Bets (Tag)](/tags/bets)_

### Risk

A possibility of loss or cost.  Anything that _can_ go wrong on a project, or is _going_ wrong, but resists exact realization.  We talk about risk because we wish to recognise both the range of possibilities and the range of cost.  

Usually broken down into: 

#### Attendant Risk

A Risk you expect to face as the result of [Taking Action](#taking-action).   

_See: [Attendant Risk (Tag)](/tags/attendant-risk)_

#### Hidden Risk

Risks you aren't aware of when you consider [Taking Action](#taking-action).  i.e. an _unknown unknown_.   

_See: [Hidden Risk (Tag)](/tags/hidden-risk)_

#### Mitigated Risk

Risks that, as a result of [Taking Action](#taking-action) have been minimized.  

_See: [De-Risking](../thinking/De-Risking.md)_

#### Upside Risk

The possibility of things going well, and leaving us with a benefit.  We may [take action](#taking-action) to maximize the likelihood and return of upside risks.  

_See: [Risk-First Analysis](../estimating/Risk-First-Analysis.md)_

### Risk Landscape

A hypothetical landscape on which risks can be placed.  [Taking Action](#taking-action) means making a move on the [Risk Landscape](#risk-landscape) to reposition a project so that it has a different profile of [Attendant Risks](#attendant-risk).   

_See: [Risk Landscape (Tag)](/tags/risk-landscape)_

### Stake

An [Attendant Risk](#attendant-risk) of taking some [action](#taking-action), which is fairly well known up front.  Placing a bet on a horse-race is a stake because you know how much you are likely to lose. 

_See: [Bets (Tag)](/tags/bets)_

### Taking Action

Refers to any activity in the project.  Actions are taken in order to manage some risk.  At the same time, [Taking Action](#taking-action) usually means interacting with reality and updating the [Internal Model](#internal-model).  

_See: [Take Action (Tag)](/tags/take-action)_

### Value

The worth or usefulness or importance of a thing (such as an investment, trade or bet) to the possessor.

_See: [Bets (Tag)](/tags/bets)_
