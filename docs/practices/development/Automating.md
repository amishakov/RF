### Automating

One of the key ways to measure whether your team is doing _useful work_ is to look at whether, in fact, it can be automated.  And this is the spirit of [DevOps](DevOps) - the idea that people in general are poor at repeatable tasks, and anything people do repeatedly _should_ be automated.  

Repetitive work of any kind is a [Process Risk](../risks/Process-Risk.md), and can be mitigated at the expense of attendant [Complexity Risk](../risks/Complexity-Risk.md) and [Schedule Risk](../risks/Scarcity-Risk.md#schedule-risk).

Since this is a trade-off, you have to be careful about how you _weigh_ the [Process Risk](../risks/Process-Risk.md):  clearly, it exists _into the future_.  

You are making a bet that acting now will pay off in decreased [Process Risk](../risks/Process-Risk.md) over the lifetime of the project.  This is a hard thing to judge:
 - How much [Process Risk](../risks/Process-Risk.md) are we carrying, week-to-week?  (A good way to answer this is to look at past failures).
 - How much [Complexity Risk](../risks/Complexity-Risk.md) will we pick up?
 - How much [Schedule Risk](../risks/Scarcity-Risk.md#schedule-risk) (in spent developer effort) will we pick up?
 - How long will the mitigation last before the process changes again?
