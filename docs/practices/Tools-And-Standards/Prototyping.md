## Description

> "Prototyping is an iterative, trial-and-error method of system development in which requirements are converted to a working system that is continually revised through close work between an analyst and user until the latter is satisfied that an acceptable system has been developed." - [Prototyping, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototyping)

Prototyping in software development involves creating early models or mockups of the software to test concepts and gather feedback. This practice helps in validating design choices, identifying potential issues, and ensuring that the final product meets the users' needs and expectations.
