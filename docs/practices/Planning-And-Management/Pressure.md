## Description

> "Psychological stress in the workplace refers to the emotional strain and pressure that can arise from job demands, work environment, and organizational practices. Excessive stress can lead to negative health outcomes, reduced productivity, and decreased job satisfaction." - [Psychological stress, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_stress)

Applying pressure involves exerting influence on team members to ensure tasks are completed on time and to a high standard. This practice is often used in high-stakes projects where meeting deadlines and maintaining quality is critical.  While it can be effective in ensuring timely completion of tasks, it must be applied judiciously to avoid negative consequences such as burnout, decreased quality, and reduced morale.
