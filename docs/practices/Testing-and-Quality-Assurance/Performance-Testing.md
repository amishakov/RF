## Description

> "Performance testing is a general term used to describe tests that verify a system's stability, responsiveness, and scalability under a particular workload." - [Performance testing, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_testing)

Performance Testing involves evaluating the performance of software applications under various conditions to ensure they meet required standards for speed, scalability, and stability. This practice helps in identifying and mitigating performance issues before they impact end users.
