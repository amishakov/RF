## Description

> "Unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code—sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures—are tested to determine whether they are fit for use." - [Unit testing, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)

Unit testing involves writing and running tests for individual units or components of the software to ensure they function as expected. This practice helps in identifying and fixing issues early in the development process, making the codebase more reliable and maintainable.
