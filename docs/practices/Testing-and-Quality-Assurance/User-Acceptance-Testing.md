## Description

> "User acceptance testing (UAT) is a phase of software development in which the software is tested in the 'real world' by the intended audience." - [User acceptance testing, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_acceptance_testing)

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) involves having end users test the software to ensure it meets their requirements and expectations. This practice helps in identifying any issues that may not have been caught during previous testing phases and ensures that the final product is user-friendly and functional.
