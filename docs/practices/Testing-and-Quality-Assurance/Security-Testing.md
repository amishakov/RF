## Description

> "Security testing is a process intended to reveal flaws in the security mechanisms of an information system that protect data and maintain functionality as intended." - [Security testing, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_testing)

Security Testing involves assessing the security of software applications to identify vulnerabilities and ensure they are protected against threats and attacks. This practice is essential for maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of software systems.
