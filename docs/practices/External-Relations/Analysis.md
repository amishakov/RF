  mitigates:
   - tag: Implementation Risk
     reason: "Ensures that requirements and specifications are clearly understood before development begins."
   - tag: Communication Risk
     reason: "Facilitates clear communication of requirements and expectations among stakeholders."
   - tag: Feature Fit Risk
     reason: "Analysis of problems helps you make sure you come up with the right solution."
   - tag: Contextual Risk
     reason: "Developing an understanding the context into which a solution is put avoids legal and social problems."
  attendant:
   - tag: Schedule Risk
     reason: "Can be time-consuming, potentially delaying the start of development."
   - tag: Agency Risk
     reason: "Creates dependencies on the availability and accuracy of information from stakeholders."
   - tag: Boundary Risk

## Description

> "Systems analysis is a problem-solving technique that decomposes a system into its component pieces for the purpose of studying how well those component parts work and interact to accomplish their purpose." - [Systems analysis, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_analysis)

Analysis in software development involves examining and breaking down the requirements, systems, and processes to understand the needs and ensure the correct implementation of the software. This practice is crucial for identifying potential issues, clarifying requirements, and ensuring that the development aligns with business goals and user needs.
