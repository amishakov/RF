## Description

> "A contract is a legally binding agreement that recognizes and governs the rights and duties of the parties to the agreement." - [Contract, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract)

Contracts in software development define the terms and conditions under which services are provided. They outline roles, responsibilities, timelines, costs, and deliverables, helping to manage expectations and reduce risks. Effective contract management is crucial for ensuring that all parties adhere to agreed-upon terms and that the project runs smoothly.
