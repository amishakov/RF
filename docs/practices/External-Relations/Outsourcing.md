## Description

> "Outsourcing is an agreement in which one company hires another company to be responsible for a planned or existing activity that is or could be done internally, and sometimes involves transferring employees and assets from one firm to another." - [Outsourcing, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing)

Outsourcing in software development involves hiring external vendors or service providers to handle specific tasks or projects. This practice can help access specialized skills, reduce costs, and accelerate project timelines. However, it also introduces risks related to dependency, communication, and security that need to be managed effectively.
