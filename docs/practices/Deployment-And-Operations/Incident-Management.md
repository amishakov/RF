## Description

> "Incident management (IM) is an IT service management (ITSM) process area. The first goal of the incident management process is to restore a normal service operation as quickly as possible and to minimize the impact on business operations, thus ensuring that the best possible levels of service quality and availability are maintained." - [Incident management (ITSM), _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_management_(ITSM))

Issue Management involves the activities an organization undertakes to identify, analyze, and correct hazards to prevent future occurrences. Effective issue management is crucial to minimizing the impact of incidents on business operations and ensuring a quick return to normalcy.
