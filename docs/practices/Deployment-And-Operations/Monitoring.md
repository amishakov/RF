## Description

> "Network monitoring is the use of a system that constantly monitors a computer network for slow or failing components and that notifies the network administrator (via email, SMS or other alarms) in case of outages or other trouble. Network monitoring is part of network management." - [Network monitoring, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_monitoring)

Monitoring encompasses a wide range of practices designed to ensure that systems operate efficiently and without interruption. This includes tracking the performance, availability, and security of networks, systems, and applications. Effective monitoring helps in early detection of issues, allowing for prompt resolution and minimizing the impact on operations.
