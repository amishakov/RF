risks in Release/Delivery

Practice Icons
Not abstract risks - use concrete ones.

Risk intros - make sure we have all of them.
Risk lists - add for feature, dependency etc.
Need to link risk hierarchies.

DON'T WORK ON THINKING IN THIS BRANCH


Looking for balance: 

grep -R " - tag:" docs/practices | sed 's/.*://' | sort | uniq -c


Pressure?
