## Description

**Coding** is the main practice that identifies us as working on a _software project_:  Actually entering instructions in a language that the computer will understand, be it Java, C++, Matlab, Excel or _whatever_.   It is transferring the ideas in your head into steps that the computer can understand, or, as Wikipedia has it:

> "...actual writing of source code." -- [Wikipedia, _Computer Programming_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming)

Often, this can be called "programming", "hacking" or "development", although that latter term tends to connotate more than just programming work, such as [Requirements Capture](Requirements-Capture) or [Documentation](Documentation.md), but we're considering those separately on different pages.
