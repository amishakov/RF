  mitigates:
   - tag: Feature Fit Risk
     reason: "Ensures that the features conform to predefined standards, reducing variability and potentially widening accessibility."
   - tag: Operational Risk
     reason: "Reduces operational errors by providing clear guidelines and protocols."
   - tag: Communication Risk
     reason: "Improves communication by using a common language and standardized terms."
   - tag: Lock-In Risk
     reason: "Using software that adheres to standards allows for swapping out components and promotes competition amongst dependencies."
  attendant:
   - tag: Inflexibility Risk
     reason: "May limit creativity and flexibility by enforcing strict adherence to standards."
   - tag: Schedule Risk
     reason: "Adhering to standards can introduce scope creep during the implementation phase."
   - tag: Compliance Risk
     reason: "Ensuring continuous compliance with evolving standards can be challenging."

## Description

> "Standardization (or standardisation) is the process of developing and implementing technical standards. It can help to maximize compatibility, interoperability, safety, repeatability, or quality." - [Standardization, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization)

Standardisation involves creating, implementing, and enforcing standards and guidelines to ensure consistency, compatibility, and quality across software projects. This practice helps in maintaining uniformity, reducing complexity, and improving communication among team members and stakeholders.
