## Description

> "Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently." - [Pair programming, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)

Pair Programming involves two developers working together on the same code. One developer writes the code while the other reviews each line in real-time, providing instant feedback and suggestions. This practice not only improves code quality but also facilitates knowledge sharing and collaboration between team members.
