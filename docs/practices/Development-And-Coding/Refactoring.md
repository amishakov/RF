## Description

> "Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the factoring—without changing its external behavior. Refactoring improves nonfunctional attributes of the software." - [Code refactoring, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring)

Refactoring involves revising and restructuring existing code to improve its readability, maintainability, and performance without changing its external behavior. This practice helps in reducing technical debt, enhancing code quality, and making the codebase easier to understand and modify.
