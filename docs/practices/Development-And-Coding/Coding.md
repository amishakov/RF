## Description

> "Coding, in the context of software engineering, is the process of designing and building an executable computer program for accomplishing a specific computing task.": - [Coding, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming)

Coding is a core activity in software development, involving the translation of requirements and designs into functional code. High-quality coding practices are essential for creating reliable, maintainable, and efficient software. This involves writing clear, well-structured, and documented code that adheres to established standards and best practices.
