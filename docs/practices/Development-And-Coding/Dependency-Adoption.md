     reason: "Reduces the risk of relying on proprietary or less widely adopted solutions."
   - tag: Complexity Risk
     reason: "Can reduce the amount of code you are responsible for, hence the amount of 'owned' complexity."

   - tag: Funding Risk
     reason: "Can incur costs associated with adopting standards or libraries."
