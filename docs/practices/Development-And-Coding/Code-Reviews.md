## Description

> "In software development, code review is a systematic examination of computer source code. It is intended to find and fix mistakes overlooked in the initial development phase, improving the overall quality of software." - [Code review, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review)

Code reviews involve evaluating code written by team members to ensure it meets the required standards and is free of defects. This practice helps in maintaining code quality, consistency, and reliability. By catching issues early, code reviews can prevent larger problems down the line and facilitate knowledge sharing among team members.
