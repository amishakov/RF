     reason: "Prototyping allows you to explore an idea or design without committing to it.  If the design turns out to be over-complex, it can be avoided."

     reason: "A prototype often allows for communicating a design or idea in a way that a written document or diagram wouldn't."

     reason: "Prototypes that turn into the chosen solution often take shortcuts in design that are not rectified."

## Description

> "A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept or process." - [Prototype, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype)

Prototyping is a popular technique in software development as it allows you to address key high-risk problems in design without committing to building a full implementation.  

This creates _optionality_ in that you can learn about the pitfalls of a particular approach or solution in a low-stakes way without necessarily committing to a particular approach or solution.
