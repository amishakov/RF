## Description

> "A retrospective is a look back at events that took place, or works that were produced, in the past." - [Retrospective, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective)

In agile software development, retrospectives are regular meetings where the team reflects on what went well, what didn't, and how they can improve. These meetings are crucial for continuous improvement, fostering a culture of learning, and enhancing team collaboration and performance.
