## Description

> "Documentation is any communicable material that is used to describe, explain, or instruct regarding some attributes of an object, system or procedure, such as its parts, assembly, installation, maintenance and use." - [Documentation, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation)

Documentation in software development provides a detailed description of the software, its components, and its usage. It serves as a vital reference for developers, users, and stakeholders, helping to ensure that everyone has a clear understanding of the system. High-quality documentation is essential for effective communication, troubleshooting, and future development.
