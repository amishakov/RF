## Description

> "A technology demonstration (or tech demo), also known as demonstrator model, is a prototype, rough example or otherwise incomplete version of a conceivable product or future system, put together as proof of concept with the primary purpose of showcasing the possible applications, feasibility, performance and method of an idea for a new technology." - [Technology demonstration, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_demonstration)

A demo in software development involves showcasing a working version or prototype of the product to stakeholders. This helps in verifying that the product aligns with client needs and expectations, facilitates feedback, and identifies any potential issues early in the development process. Demos are crucial for communicating the functionality, performance, and feasibility of the software to clients, investors, and other stakeholders.
