     reason: "Continuous Integration (CI) regularly integrates code changes into a shared repository to detect and fix problems early."
     use:
       - Continuous Integration (CI)
   - tag: Monitoring
     reason: "Monitoring and logging, along with observability, are critical for identifying issues and opportunities for improvement in DevOps."
     use:
       - Monitoring and Logging
       - Observability
   - tag: Prototyping
     reason: "Canary releases and blue-green deployments are used to test new features in a controlled manner."
     use:
       - Canary Releases
       - Blue-Green Deployment
   - tag: Redundancy
     reason: "Load balancing and redundancy are crucial for maintaining uptime in a DevOps environment."
     use:
       - Load Balancing
       - Redundancy
   - tag: Release Delivery
     reason: "Continuous Delivery (CD), Continuous Deployment, and Blue-Green Deployment ensure smooth and frequent releases."
     use:
       - Continuous Delivery (CD)
       - Continuous Deployment
       - Blue-Green Deployment
   - tag: Security Testing

## Description

> "DevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry. Used as a set of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) as a means for improving and shortening the systems development life cycle." - [DevOps, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps)

DevOps emphasizes collaboration between development and operations teams to improve efficiency, reliability, and scalability. Key practices in DevOps include continuous integration, continuous delivery, infrastructure as code, monitoring and logging, automated testing, and configuration management. DevOps focuses on automating and streamlining the software development and deployment process.

### Additional DevOps Practices

- **Microservices Architecture**: Designing applications as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services.
- **Service Discovery**: Automatically detecting and connecting to services in a microservices architecture.
- **Security as Code**: Integrating security practices into the DevOps pipeline.
- **Automated Security Testing**: Using automated tools to perform security checks throughout the development and deployment process.

These practices highlight the core elements of DevOps and how they align with your provided list.
