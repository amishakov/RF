## Description

> "Extreme Programming (XP) is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development, it advocates frequent 'releases' in short development cycles, which improves productivity and introduces checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted." - [Extreme Programming, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming)

Extreme Programming (XP) is an Agile framework that emphasizes customer satisfaction, teamwork, and frequent delivery of small, functional software increments. Key practices in XP include pair programming, test-driven development, continuous integration, refactoring, and simple design. XP focuses on improving software quality and responding to changing customer requirements through frequent releases and continuous feedback.

In addition to the practices described above, XP promotes a sustainable work pace to avoid burnout, encouraging a maximum of 40-hour work weeks and avoiding overtime as much as possible.
