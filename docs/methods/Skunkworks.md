### SkunkWorks

The [SkunkWorks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_Works) approach is one small step up from **Prototyping**.  Wikipedia describes this as:

>  A group within an organization given a high degree of autonomy and unhampered by bureaucracy, with the task of working on advanced or secret projects

The idea here is _again_ to minimize the length of the feedback loop, and focus on [Design](Design.md) to combat [Conceptual Integrity Risk](../risks/Feature-Risk.md).  It was in this kind of small, secret team that the [iPhone was invented](https://www.networkworld.com/article/2159873/smartphones/apple-s-iphone--the-untold-story.html).  

To give some idea of the [Conceptual Integrity Risk](../risks/Feature-Risk.md) involved, initially, the team were building a _tablet_ using the multi-touch technology that the iPhone introduced to the world, but pivoted towards the phones after the failure of the "Apple Phone" collaboration with Motorola.

Scott Forstall picked a small, secret team from within the ranks of Apple.  By doing this, he mitigated [Communication Risk](../risks/Communication-Risk.md) and [../risks/Coordination Risk](../risks/Coordination-Risk.md) _within his team_, but having fewer people in the room meant more [Throughput Risk](../risks/Scarcity-Risk.md#schedule-risk).

By having more people involved, the feedback loop will be longer than the two-man prototyping team, but that's the tradeoff you get for mitigating those other risks.
