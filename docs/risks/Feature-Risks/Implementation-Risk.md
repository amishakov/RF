![Implementation Risk](/img/generated/risks/feature/feature-implementation-risk.png) 

The [Feature Risk](/tags/Feature-Risk) family also includes things that don't work as expected, that is to say, [bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug).   Although the distinction between "a missing feature" and "a broken feature" might be worth making in the development team, we can consider these both the same kind of risk:  _the software doesn't do what the user expects_.  We call these [Implementation Risks](/tags/Implementation-Risk).  

As shown in the above diagram, we can mitigate this risk with _feedback_ from users, as well as further _development_ and _testing_.

It's worth pointing out that sometimes, _the user expects the wrong thing_.  This is a different but related risk, which could be down to [training](/tags/Training), [documentation](/tags/Documentation) or simply a [poor user interface](/tags/Communication-Risk) (and we'll look at that more in [Communication Risk](/tags/Communication-Risk).)
