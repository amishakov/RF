Feature Access Risks are risks due to some clients not having access to some or all of the features in your product.

Sometimes features can work for some people and not others:  this could be down to [Accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility) issues, language barriers, localisation or security.

You could argue that the choice of _platform_ is also going to limit access:  writing code for XBox-only leaves PlayStation owners out in the cold.   This is _largely_ [Feature Access Risk](Feature-Risk.md#feature-access-risk), though [Dependency Risk](Dependency-Risk.md) is related here.

In marketing terms, minimising [Feature Access Risk](#feature-access-risk) is all about [Segmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_segmentation):  trying to work out _who_ your product is for and tailoring it to that particular market.  As shown in the diagram above, mitigating [Feature Access Risk](#feature-access-risk) means increasing complexity:  you have to deliver the software on more platforms, localised in more languages, with different configurations of features.  It also means increased development effort.
