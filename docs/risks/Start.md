# Risks

Much of the content of [Risk-First](https://riskfirst.org) is a collection of [Risks as Patterns](A-Pattern-Language).  

Here, we're going to take you through the various types of Risk you will face on every software project.  

In [Thinking Risk-First](/thinking/One-Size-Fits-No-One), we saw how _Lean Software Development_ owed its existence to production-line manufacturing techniques developed at Toyota.  And we saw that the _Waterfall_ approach originally came from engineering.  If Risk-First is anything, it's about applying the techniques of _Risk Management_ to the discipline of _Software Development_ (there's nothing new under the sun, after all).  

One key activity of Risk Management we haven't discussed yet is _categorizing_ risks. So, this track of Risk-First is all about developing categories of risks for use in Software Development.

## Outcomes

After reading this section of [Risk-First](https://riskfirst.org), hopefully you will:

 - Appreciate the **different kinds of risk** you face on software projects, and how to identify them.
 - Learn a **Pattern Language**: that is, a vocabulary of terms which you can use for discussing these risks with colleagues.
 - Know the main **actions you can take** to handle each type of risk.
