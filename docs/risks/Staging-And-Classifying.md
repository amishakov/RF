# Staging and Classifying

![Staged and Classified Beetle Collection, (Credit: Fir0002, Wikipedia)](/img/Beetle_collection_short.jpg)

Our tour is complete.  

But if we are good collectors, then before we finish we should _[Stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomological_equipment_for_mounting_and_storage)_ our specimens and do some work in classifying what we've seen.

## Towards A "Periodic Table" Of Risks

As we said [at the start](A-Pattern-Language), Risk-First is all about developing _A Pattern Language_.  We can use the terms like "[Feature Fit Risk](/tags/Feature-Fit-Risk)" or "[Internal Model Risk](/tags/Internal-Model-Risk)" to explain phenomena we see on software projects.   If we want to [De-Risk](/thinking/De-Risking) our work, we need this power of explanation so we can talk about how to go about it.

![Periodic Table of Risks, Horizontal](/img/generated/staging-and-classifying/periodic-horizontal.svg)

The diagram above compiles all of the risks we've seen so far on our tour across the [Risk Landscape](/risks/Risk-Landscape).  Just like a periodic table, there are perhaps others left to discover.   _Unlike_ a periodic table, these risks are not completely distinct: they mix like paint and blend into one another.  

On this journey around the [Risk Landscape](/risks/Risk-Landscape) we've collected a (hopefully) good, representative sample of [Risks](/tags/Risk) and where to find them. But there are more out there.   How many of these have you seen on your projects?  What is missing?  What is wrong?

Please help by reporting back what you find.
