### Example: Map And Territory Risk Drives The Hype Cycle

Most ideas (and most products) have a slow, hard climb to wide-scale adoption.  But some ideas seem to disperse much more rapidly and are picked up quickly because they are exciting, having greater "memetic potential" within a population.  One way this evolution manifests itself in the world is though the [Hype Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle):

> "The hype cycle is a branded graphical presentation developed and used by the American research, advisory and information technology firm Gartner, for representing the maturity, adoption and social application of specific technologies. The hype cycle provides a graphical and conceptual presentation of the maturity of emerging technologies through five phases." - [Hype Cycle, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle)

![Hype Cycle, along with Map & Territory Risk](/img/numbers/hype1.png)

The five phases (and the "Hype" itself as the thick black line) are shown in the chart above.  We start off at the "Technology Trigger", moving to the "Peak of Inflated Expectations", then to the "Trough of Disillusionment" and finally up the "Slope of Enlightenment" to the "Plateau of Productivity".  

The concept of [Map and Territory Risk](/tags/Map-And-Territory-Risk) actually helps explain why this curve has the shape it does.  To see why, let's consider each line in turn:

 - The **Awareness** (or enthusiasm for) the idea within the population is the dotted line.
 
 - The **Knowledge** (or _understanding_) of the idea within the audience (a [Learning Curve](/tags/Learning-Curve-Risk), if you will) is the dashed line.  Both of these are modelled with [Cumulative Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function#Use_in_statistical_analysis) functions which are often used for modelling the spread of a phenomena (disease, product uptake, idea) within a population.  As you would expect, **Knowledge** increases less rapidly than **Awareness**. 

 - **Map And Territory Risk** is the difference between **Awareness** and **Knowledge**.  It's highest point is where the **Awareness** of the idea is farthest from the **Knowledge** of it.  

 - **Hype** is calculated here as being the **Awareness** line, subtracting **Map and Territory Risk** from a point lagging behind the current time (since it takes time to appreciate this risk).  As the population appreciates more [Map and Territory Risk](/tags/Map-And-Territory-Risk), **Hype** decreases.   
 
At the point where the effect of [Map and Territory Risk](/tags/Map-And-Territory-Risk) is at its greatest we end up in the "Trough of Disillusionment".  Eventually, we escape the trough as **Knowledge** and understanding of the idea increases, reducing [Map and Territory Risk](/tags/Map-And-Territory-Risk).
 
![Hype Cycle 2: more even growth of Awareness and Knowledge means no "Trough of Disillusionment"](/img/numbers/hype2.png)

As you might expect, the "Trough of Disillusionment" exists because the **Awareness** of the idea and the **Knowledge** about it increase at different rates.
 
Where the **Awareness** and **Knowledge** grow more evenly together, there is no spike in [Map and Territory Risk](/tags/Map-And-Territory-Risk) and we don't see the corresponding "Trough of Disillusionment" at all, as shown in the above chart.
