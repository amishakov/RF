# Environmental Risks

In this section we're going to start considering the realities of running software systems in the real world.  

It's important to understand that software is always operating within a context.  Whether it's a product being offered by a startup, some utility downloaded from an app store or a large government or enterprise deployment, the context really matters, and therefore the risks presented by this context are relevant to the overall risk position of the software itself.  

## PEST / PESTLE

One useful technique for environmental analysis is [PEST or PESTLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEST_analysis), which breaks down the environment into specific components: Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and Ecological.  Other frameworks suggest looking at Demographic, Geographic or Military elements too.    
 
## Types Of Environmental Risk

There is a lot to this subject, so this section is just a taster: we're going to consider just two specific types of environmental risk, [Security Risk](/tags/Security-Risk), [Legal Risk](/tags/Legal-Risk) and [Reputational Risk](/tags/Reputational-Risk).  And then cap off the taxonomy of risks by looking at [Operational Risk](/tags/Operational-Risk), which really encompasses the others.
