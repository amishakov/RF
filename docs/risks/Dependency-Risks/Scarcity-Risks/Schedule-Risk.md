[Schedule Risk](/tags/Schedule-Risk) is very pervasive, and really underlies _everything_ we do.  People _want_ things, but they _want them at a certain time_.   We need to eat and drink every day, for example.  We might value having a great meal, but not if we have to wait three weeks for it.  

And let's go completely philosophical for a second:  were you to attain immortality, you'd probably not feel the need to buy _anything_.  You'd clearly have no _needs_. Anything you wanted, you could create yourself within your infinite time-budget.  _Rocks don't need money_, after all.

In the section on [Feature Risk](/tags/Feature-Risk) we looked at [Market Risk](/tags/Feature-Risk), the idea that the value of your product is itself at risk from the whims of the market, share prices being the obvious example of that effect.  In Finance, we measure this using _price_, and we can put together probability models based on how much _money_ you might make or lose.

With [Schedule Risk](/tags/Schedule-Risk), the underlying measure is _time_:  

 - "If I implement feature X, I'm picking up something like 5 days of [Schedule Risk](/tags/Schedule-Risk)."
 - "If John goes travelling that's going to hit us with lots of [Schedule Risk](/tags/Schedule-Risk) while we train up Anne."
 
... and so on.  Clearly, in the same way as you don't know exactly how much money you might lose or gain on the stock-exchange, you can't put precise numbers on [Schedule Risk](/tags/Schedule-Risk) either.
