Since staff are a scarce resource, it stands to reason that if a startup has a "Runway", then the chances are that the founders and staff do too<!-- tweet-end -->, as [this article by Entrepreneur.com explores](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/223135).  It identifies the following risks:

  - **Company Cash**:  the **Runway** of the startup itself
  - **Founder Cash**:  the **Runway** for a founder, before they run out of money and can't afford their rent.
  - **Team Cash**:  the **Runway** for team members, who may not have the same appetite for risk as the founders do.
  
You need to consider how long your staff are going to be around, especially if you have [Key Person Risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_person_insurance#Key_person_definition) on some of them.  <!-- tweet-end -->People like to have new challenges, move on to live in new places, or simply get bored.  Replacing staff can be highly risky.

The longer your project goes on for, the more [Staff Risk](Scarcity-Risk.md#staff-risk) you will have to endure, and you can't rely on getting the [best staff for failing projects](/tags/Agency-Risk).

### Student Syndrome

[Student Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_syndrome) is, according to Wikipedia:

> "Student syndrome refers to planned procrastination, when, for example, a student will only start to apply themselves to an assignment at the last possible moment before its deadline."   - _[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_syndrome)_

Arguably, there is good psychological, evolutionary and risk-based reasoning behind procrastination:  if there is apparently a lot of time to get a job done, then [Schedule Risk](/tags/Schedule-Risk) is low.  If we're only ever mitigating our _biggest risks_, then managing [Schedule Risk](/tags/Schedule-Risk) in the future doesn't matter so much.  Putting efforts into mitigating future risks that _might not arise_ is wasted effort.

Or at least, that's the argument:  if you're [Discounting the Future To Zero](/thinking/Evaluating-Risk.md) then you'll be pulling all-nighters in order to deliver any assignment.   

So, the problem with [Student Syndrome](#student-syndrome) is that the _very mitigation_ for [Schedule Risk](/tags/Schedule-Risk) (allowing more time) is an [Attendant Risk](/thinking/Glossary.md#attendant-risk) that _causes_ [Schedule Risk](/tags/Schedule-Risk):   you'll work within the more generous time allocation more slowly and you'll end up revealing [Hidden Risk](/thinking/Glossary.md#hidden-risk) _later_.  And, discovering these hidden risks later causes you to end up being late because of them.
