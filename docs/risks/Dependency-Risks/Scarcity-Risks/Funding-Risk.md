On a lot of software projects you are "handed down" deadlines from above and told to deliver by a certain date or face the consequences. <!-- tweet-end --> But sometimes you're given a budget instead, which really just adds another layer of abstraction to the [Schedule Risk](Scarcity-Risk.md#schedule-risk).  That is, do I have enough funds to cover the team for as long as I need them?

This grants you some leeway as now you have two variables to play with: the _size_ of the team, and _how long_ you can run it for.  The larger the team, the shorter the time you can afford to pay for it.

In startup circles, this "amount of time you can afford it" is called the ["Runway"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/runway):  you have to get the product to "take-off" (become profitable) before the runway ends. 

Startups often spend a lot of time courting investors in order to get funding and mitigate this type of [Schedule Risk](Scarcity-Risk.md#schedule-risk).<!-- tweet-end -->  But, as shown in the diagram above, this activity usually comes at the expense of [Opportunity Risk](Scarcity-Risk.md#opportunity-risk) and [Feature Risk](Feature-Risk.md), as usually the same people are diverted into raise funds instead of building the project itself.
