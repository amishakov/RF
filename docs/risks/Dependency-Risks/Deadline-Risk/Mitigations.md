## Slack

Each party can mitigate [Deadline Risk](/tags/Deadline-Risk) with _slack_.  That is, ensuring that the exact time of the event isn't critical to your plans:   

 - Don't build into your plans a _need_ to start shopping at 9am.
 - Arrive at the bus-stop _early_.

The amount of slack you build into the schedule is likely dependent on the level of risk you face:  I tend to arrive a few minutes early for a bus, because the risk is _low_ (there'll be another bus along soon).  However, I try to arrive over an hour early for a flight, because I can't simply get on the next flight straight away and I've already paid for it, so the risk is _high_.
 
[Deadline Risk](/tags/Deadline-Risk) becomes very hard to manage when you have to coordinate actions with lots of tightly-constrained events.  So what else can give?  We can reduce the number of _parties_ involved in the event, which reduces risk, or, we can make sure all the parties are in the same _place_ to begin with.  

## Focus

Often when running a software project you're given a team of people and told to get something delivered by a certain date, i.e. you have an artificially-imposed deadline on delivery.

What happens if you miss the deadline?  It could be:

 - The funding on the project runs out, and it gets cancelled.
 - You have to go back to a budgeting committee to get more money.
 - Members of the team get replaced because of lack of faith.
 
.. or something else.  So [Deadline Risk](/tags/Deadline-Risk) can be introduced by an authority in order to _sharpen focus_.  This is how we arrive at tools like [SMART Objectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) and [KPI's (Key Performance Indicators)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator).  

Deadlines change the way we evaluate goals and the solutions we choose because they force us to reckon with [Deadline Risk](/tags/Deadline-Risk).  For example, in JFK's quote:

> "First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth." -  John F. Kennedy, 1961

The 9-year timespan came from an authority figure (the president) and helped a huge team of people coordinate their efforts and arrive at a solution that would work within a given time-frame.  The [Deadline Risk](/tags/Deadline-Risk) allowed the team to focus on mitigating the risk of missing that deadline.

Compare with this quote:  

> “I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by.” - [Douglas Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams)

As a successful author, Douglas Adams _didn't really care_ about the deadlines his publisher's gave him.  The [Deadline Risk](/tags/Deadline-Risk) was minimal for him, because the publisher wouldn't be able to give his project to someone else to complete.
