![Lock-In Risk Decreases With Bridges and Standards](/img/generated/risks/boundary/cycle.svg) 

[Lock-In Risk](/tags/Lock-In-Risk) seems to progress in cycles.  As a piece of technology becomes more mature, there are more standards and bridges, and [Lock-In Risk](/tags/Lock-In-Risk) is lower.  Once [Lock-In Risk](/tags/Lock-In-Risk) is low and a particular approach is proven a technology becomes a commodity.  After that, there will be innovation upon this, giving rise to new opportunities for [Lock-In Risk](/tags/Lock-In-Risk) (see the diagram above).  Here are some examples:

 - **Processor Chips.**  By providing features (instructions) on their processors that other vendors didn't have, manufacturers made their processors more attractive to system integrators.  However, since the instructions were different on different chips, this created [Lock-In Risk](/tags/Lock-In-Risk) for the integrators.  Intel and Microsoft were able to use this fact to build a big ecosystem around Windows running on Intel chips (so called, WinTel).  The Intel instruction set is nowadays a _de-facto_ standard for PCs.

 - **Browsers.** In the late 1990s, faced with the emergence of the nascent World Wide Web, and the [Netscape Navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator) browser, [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) adopted a strategy known as [Embrace and Extend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace_and_extend).  The idea of this was to subvert the HTML standard to their own ends by _embracing_ the standard and creating their own browser Internet Explorer and then _extending_ it with as much functionality as possible, which would then _not work_ in Netscape Navigator.  They then embarked on a campaign to try and get everyone to "upgrade" to Internet Explorer.   In this way, they hoped to "own" the Internet, or at least, the software of the browser, which they saw as analogous to being the "operating system" of the Internet, and therefore a threat to their own operating system, [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows).

 - **Mobile Operating Systems.** We currently have just two main _mobile_ ecosystems (although there used to be many more):  [Apple's iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS) and [Google's Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)), which are both _very_ different and complex ecosystems with large, complex boundaries.  They are both innovating as fast as possible to keep users happy with their features.  Tools like [Xamarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xamarin) exist which allow you to build applications sharing code over both platforms.

 - **Cloud Computing.** [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services) are competing with [Microsoft Azure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure) and [Google Cloud Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform) over building tools for [Platform as a Service (PaaS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) (running software in the cloud).  They are both racing to build new functionality, but it's hard to move from one vendor to another.  Standards like [Kubernetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes) attempt to address this.
