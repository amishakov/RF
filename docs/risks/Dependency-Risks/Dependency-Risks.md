# Dependency Risks

[Dependency Risk](/tags/Dependency-Risk) is the risk you take on whenever you have a dependency on something (or someone) else.   <!-- tweet-end -->

One simple example could be that the software service you write might depend on hardware to run on:  if the server goes down, the service goes down too.  In turn, the server depends on electricity from a supplier, as well as a network connection from a provider.  If either of these dependencies aren't met, the service is out of commission.

Dependencies can be on _events_, _people_, _teams_, _work_, _processes_, _software_, _services_, _money_ and pretty much _any resource_, and while every project will need some of these, they also _add risk_ to any project because the reliability of the project itself is now a function involving the reliability of the dependency.  

In order to avoid repetition, and also to break down this large topic, we're going to look at this over 7 sections:   

 - This first section will look at dependencies _in general_, and some of the variations of [Dependency Risk](/tags/Dependency-Risk).
 - Next, we'll look at [Scarcity Risk](/tags/Scarcity-Risk), because time, money and staff are scarce resources in every project.
 - We'll cover [Deadline Risk](/tags/Deadline-Risk), and discuss the purpose of Events and Deadlines, and how they enable us to coordinate around dependency use.
 - Then, we'll move on to look specifically at [Software Dependency Risk](/tags/Software-Dependency-Risk), covering using libraries, software services and building on top of the work of others.
 - Then, we'll take a look at [Process Risk](/tags/Process-Risk), which is still [Dependency Risk](/tags/Dependency-Risk), but we'll be considering more organisational factors and how bureaucracy comes into the picture.
 - After that, we'll take a closer look at [Lock-In Risk](/tags/Lock-In-Risk) and [Dead-End Risk](/tags/Dead-End-Risk).  These are the risks you face in making choices about what to depend on.
 - Finally, we'll wrap up this analysis with a look at some of the specific problems around depending on other people or businesses in [Agency Risk](/tags/Agency-Risk).
  
## Why Have Dependencies?

Luckily for us, the things we depend on in life are, for the most part, abundant:  water to drink, air to breathe, light, heat and most of the time, food for energy.  

This isn't even lucky though: life has adapted to build dependencies on things that it can _rely_ on.  

Although life exists at the bottom of the ocean around [hydrothermal vents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent), it is a very different kind of life to ours and has a different set of dependencies given its circumstances. 

This tells us a lot about [Dependency Risk](/tags/Dependency-Risk) right here:

 - On the one hand, _depending on something_ is very often helpful, and quite often essential.  (For example, all life seem to depend on water).
 - Successful organisms _adapt_ to the dependencies available to them (like the thermal vent creatures).
 - However, as soon as you have dependencies, you need to take into account their _reliability_. (Living near a river or stream gives you access to fresh water, for example).
So, dependencies are a trade-off.  They give with one hand and take with the other.  Our modern lives are full of dependency (just think of the chains of dependency needed for putting a packet of biscuits on a supermarket shelf, for example), but we accept this risk because it makes life _easier_. 
 - There is likely to be _competition_ for a dependency when it is scarce (think of droughts and famine).
