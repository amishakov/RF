![Communication Risks, Summarised](/img/generated/risks/communication/communication_3.png)

In this section, we've looked at [Communication Risk](Communication-Risk.md) itself and broken it down into six sub-types of risk as shown in the diagram above.  Again, we are calling out _patterns_ here. You could classify communication risks in other ways, but concepts like [Learning Curve Risk](#learning-curve-risk) and [Invisibility Risk](#invisibility-risk) we will be using again in again in Risk-First.

In the next section we will address complexity head-on and understand how [Complexity Risk](Complexity-Risk.md) manifests in software projects.
