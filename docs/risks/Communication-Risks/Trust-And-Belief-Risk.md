Although protocols can sometimes handle security features of communication (such as [Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication) and preventing [man-in-the-middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)), trust goes further than this, it is the flip-side of [Agency Risk](/tags/Agency-Risk), which we will look at later:  can you be sure that the other party in the communication is acting in your best interests?
 
Even if the **receiver** trusts the **sender**, they may not _believe_ the message.  Let's look at some reasons for that:

- **[Weltanschauung (World View)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_view)**: the ethics, values and beliefs in the receiver's [Internal Model](/thinking/Glossary.md#internal-model) may be incompatible to those from the sender.
- **[Relativism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativism)** is the concept that there are no universal truths.  Every truth is from a frame of reference.  For example, what constitutes _offensive language_ is dependent on the listener.
- **[Psycholinguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycholinguistics)** is the study of how humans acquire languages.  There are different languages, dialects, and _industry dialects_.  We all understand language in different ways, take different meanings and apply different contexts to the messages.
  
From the point-of-view of [Marketing Communications](Communication-Risk.md#marketing-communications), choosing the right message is part of the battle.  You are trying to communicate your idea in such a way as to mitigate Trust & Belief Risk.
